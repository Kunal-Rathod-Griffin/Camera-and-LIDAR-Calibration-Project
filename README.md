# Camera-and-LIDAR-Calibration-Project
In this project, I performed camera and LIDAR cross-calibration, estimating intrinsic/extrinsic parameters, computing plane normals, and deriving transformations. I mapped LIDAR points to the camera frame, analyzed accuracy, and compared normal vectors between the two data sources.
